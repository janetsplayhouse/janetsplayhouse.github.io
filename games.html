			<p class="text">Not only is Janet's Playhouse a great place just to
			hang out, it is also a great source for amazing games!  You can install
			these super fun games at the bottom of the page.  Below this message
			are installation instructions, for anyone who does not know how to do it.</p>
			<p class="text">These games can currently only be played on Windows computers.
			Sorry everyone else!</p>
		</div>
		<h3 id="location">Installation Instructions</h3>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 1:<p class="text">At the bottom of this page, choose which game you would
			like to download.  Once you have chosen the game, click on the link to download the game installer.
			When you click on the link, a file will pop up at the bottom of your screen as seen below. (It may
			look different depending on what browser you are using and what version of Windows you have).
			You will then need to click on the file, or run it.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step1.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 2:<p class="text">Once you have clicked the file, your computer may alert you 
			that the file could be potentially dangerous.  You have nothing to worry about - I would never make anything that could harm
			your computer!  Once again, the warning message may look different depending on your browser and/or 
			the version of Windows you are using.  If your message looks like this, you will need to click "More
			Info".</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step2.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 3:<p class="text">Once you have clicked "More Info" (or found another way to 
			run the file despite the warning), you need to click the "Run Anyway" button in order to start the installer.
			Again, your warning message may look different from mine - just find a way to get around the warning.  
			When you click the "Run Anyway" button, the installer will launch.  Your computer will once again warn 
			you that the program is made by an unknown publisher (sorry for all the warnings).  You need to click 
			the "Yes" button in order to run the program.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step3.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 4:<p class="text">Now the game installer has launched.  The next step will ask you where you
			would like to install the game.  The default is your computer's program files folder, and this is perfectly fine.  
			I would recommend not changing the installation location, but you can change it if you would like.  Click 
			the "Next" button to continue.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step4.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 5:<p class="text">The next step is the most important.  This step will ask you if you 
			would like to create a shortcut on your desktop.  Unless you want to be digging through your program files folder, 
			I would recommend checking this box.  After you check the box, click Next.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step5.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 6:<p class="text">The next step will review your installation choices.  Make sure it says 
			"Create a desktop shortcut".  If it does not, you may want to go back and make sure you've checked the "Create a
			desktop shortcut" box on the previous page.  Click Next when you are done.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step6.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 7:<p class="text">The game you chose will then install, and the installation wizard will tell 
			you that the process is complete.  You will be given the option to launch the game immediately, you may leave it checked 
			or uncheck it as you please.  Click "Finish" to complete the setup.</p></p>
		</div>
		<img id="step-img" src="game_installation_steps/Step7.png"/>
		<div id="empty-text-area">
			<p class="step">Step 8:<p class="text">If you checked the box to launch the game immediately, the game will start 
			when you click finish.  If you would like to play later, you will notice the shortcut that has been created 
			on your desktop.  Congratulations!  Now play the game!</p></p>
